# Stochastic Integral Construction Project

## Overview

This project is an exploration of the construction of the stochastic integral. Initiated during my first year at ITM Atlantique, this project allowed me to collaborate with a PhD teacher and delve deeply into an advanced topic in stochastic processes.

## Project Background

The primary goal of this project was to understand the construction of stochastic integrals. While extensive literature exists on the theory of stochastic integrals, there was a noticeable gap in resources specifically focused on their rigorous construction. After conducting research, I discovered the book Introduction à la théorie générale des processus et intégrales stochastiques by Jean-Claude Laleuf, which provided valuable insights into the construction of stochastic integrals based on Doléans’ theorems and measures.
